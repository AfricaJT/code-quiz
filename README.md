Android User Input Course Project

A Single Screen App that gives a user a 10 question tech quiz. The User answers these questions by using a combination of RadioGroups, EditText, Checkboxes, and Switches. At the end the user can submit their answers and the app will TOAST their score across the screen. This in turn allows the user to reset the quiz and start from the top.
